# 🛡️ Software Supply Chain Risk Scorer (SBOM Analyzer)

**🔗 Live Demo:** [https://sbom-analyzer.onrender.com/](https://sbom-analyzer.onrender.com/)

> ⚠️ Hosted on Render's free tier — if the app has been idle, the first load may take 30–50 seconds to wake up.

A live risk-visibility and incident-response simulation tool for enterprise software supply chains — built for the Societe Generale Hackathon 2026 (Track: Third-Party & Software Risk).

## 🧩 Problem

When a critical vulnerability like Log4j (CVE-2021-44228) is disclosed, security teams have no fast way to answer:

- Which applications use the vulnerable library — directly or transitively?
- What's the actual blast radius if this CVE is exploited?
- Are there license compliance risks (GPL in proprietary code)?
- Which libraries are unmaintained and quietly accumulating risk?

Manual dependency tracing typically takes **40+ hours per incident**. This tool automates that entire workflow.

---

## 💡 What Makes This Different

Most SBOM scanners stop at a static table of flagged libraries. This project adds a **Blast Radius Simulator** — pick any library, simulate a new CVE, and watch a live animated graph show exactly how the vulnerability propagates from that library to every affected application, direct or transitive. It turns a compliance report into an incident-response rehearsal tool.

### Risk Scoring Model

Each dependency is scored across three risk dimensions, then weighted by the owning application's business criticality:

1. **Vulnerability risk** — CVSS score, with an added penalty if no patch is available or the vulnerability is known-exploited
2. **License risk** — GPL/AGPL-style licenses flagged when used in externally-distributed applications; MIT/Apache treated as low-risk
3. **Maintenance risk** — libraries with no updates in 2+ years are flagged as unmaintained

Final application-level risk aggregates all dependency scores, multiplied by a criticality factor (High = 1.3×, Medium = 1.0×, Low = 0.8×).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sbom-analyzer.git
cd sbom-analyzer
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Generate the dataset (first run only)
```bash
cd backend
python generate_vulns.py
python generate_sbom.py
python generate_labels.py
cd ..
```

### 4. Run the self-evaluation (optional — verifies engine accuracy)
```bash
cd backend
python evaluate.py
cd ..
```

### 5. Start the app
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in your browser.

## 📈 Self-Evaluation Results

| Metric | Result | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Precision | 100% | — |
| Recall | 100% | — |
| False Positive Rate | 0% | < 20% |
| Transitive Resolution | 100% | 100% |

*(Run on synthetic labeled data — validates the engine's internal detection logic is bug-free and consistent with the ground truth generator.)*
